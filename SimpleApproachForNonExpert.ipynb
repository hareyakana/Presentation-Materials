    "Here what I am going to proposed is a method to classify physics data into \"signal\" and \"background\" from these raw data with minimal physics based methodology reconstructed information. As physics experiments get larger and larger, so does the raw data that comes from it where reconstruction of the physics data from these raw data can consume more time than necessary for effectively physics analysis. \n"
